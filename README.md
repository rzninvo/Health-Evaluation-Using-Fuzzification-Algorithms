# Health-Evaluation-Using-Fuzzification-Algorithms

Course Project of Computational Intelligence  

Developed a system that can evaluate the health of patients which consists of three phases. 
The first phase involves fuzzification of real values, where the patient's health data is converted into fuzzy sets. 
The second phase, known as rule inference, involves applying logical rules to the fuzzy sets to determine the patient's overall health status.
The final phase is defuzzification, where the fuzzy sets are converted back to real values using the centroid integral algorithm.
